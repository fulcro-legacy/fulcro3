     - `:failed` - A deferred route took longer than can reasonably be expected (configurable timeout, default 5s)

    IMPORTANT NOTES:

    - `will-enter` for the routes will *not* get a app (since there
    isn't one).  Be sure your routers will tolerate a nil reconciler.
    - This has not been well-tested.  It is known to render correct HTML in simple cases, but the initial state
    may not actually be correct for the starting app with respect to the routers.
