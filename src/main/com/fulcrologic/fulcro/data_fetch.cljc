(defn load!
  "Load data from the server.

  This function triggers a server interaction and normalizes the server response into your app state database. During
  operation it also adds (by default) fetch markers into the app state so you can show busy indicators on the UI
  components that are waiting for data. The `:target` parameter can be used to place the data somewhere besides app
  state root (which is the default).

  The server will receive a query of the form: [({server-property (comp/get-query class-or-factory)} params)], which
  a Fulcro parser will correctly parse as a join on server-property with the given subquery and params. See the AST and
  instructions on parsing queries in the developer's guide.

  Parameters:
  - `app-or-comp` : A component instance, Fulcro application, or reconciler
  - `server-property-or-ident` : A keyword or ident that represents the root of the query to send to the server. If this is an ident
  you are loading a specific entity from the database into a local app db table. A custom target will be ignored.
  - `class-or-factory` : A component that implements IQuery, or a factory for it (if using dynamic queries). This will be combined with `server-property` into a join for the server query. Needed to normalize results.
    class-or-factory can be nil, in which case the resulting server query will not be a join.
  - `config` : A map of load configuration parameters.

  Config (all optional):
  - `target` - An assoc-in path at which to put the result of the Subquery (as an edge (normalized) or value (not normalized)).
    Can also be special targets (multiple-targets, append-to,
    prepend-to, or replace-at). If you are loading by keyword (into root), then this relocates the result (ident or value) after load.
    When loading an entity (by ident), then this option will place additional idents at the target path(s) that point to that entity.
  - `initialize` - REMOVED. Use component pre-merge instead.
  - `remote` - Optional. Keyword name of the remote that this load should come from.
  - `params` - Optional parameters to add to the generated query
  - `marker` - ID of marker. Normalizes a load marker into app state so you can see progress.
  - `refresh` - REMOVED. Not needed.
  - `parallel` - Send the load out-of-order (immediately) without waiting for other loads in progress.
  - `post-mutation` - DEPRECATED. use post-action. A mutation (symbol) to run after the data is merged. Note, if target is supplied be sure your post mutation
  should expect the data at the targeted location. The `env` of that mutation will be the env of the load (if available), but will also include `:load-request`.
  - `post-mutation-params` - An optional map  that will be passed to the post-mutation when it is called. May only contain raw data, not code!
  - `ok-action` - WARNING: OVERRIDES ALL DEFAULT OK BEHAVIOR (post-mutation, merge, clearing load marker)! A lambda that will receive the remote result in a mutation env parameter `(fn [env] ...)`.
  - `post-action` - A lambda that will receive the remote result in a mutation env parameter `(fn [env] ...)`. Called after success, like post-mutation,
  but as a lambda.
  - `error-action` - A lambda that will receive the errant result (bad server status code/body) in a mutation env parameter `(fn [env] ...)`. Like the error-action section
  of mutations.
  - `fallback` - A mutation (symbol) to run if there is a server/network error. The `env` of the fallback will be like a mutation `env`, and will
  include a `:result` key with the real result from the server.
  - `update-query` - A optional function that can transform the component query before sending to remote.
      For example, to focus a subquery using update-query:
          {:update-query #(eql/focus-subquery % [:my {:sub [:query]}])}

      Removing properties (like previous :without option):
          {:update-query #(df/elide-query-nodes % #{:my :elisions})}
  - `focus` - Focus the query along a path. See eql/focus-subquery.
  - `without` - A set of keys to remove (recursively) from the query.
  - `abort-id` - TODO. Normally use txn id, which is returned by this function.

  Returns a transaction ID, which can be used with abort
