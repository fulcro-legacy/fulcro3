(defn dirty-fields
  "Obtains all of the dirty fields for the given (denormalized) ui-entity, recursively. This works against UI props
  because submission mutations should close over the data as parameters to a mutation. In other words, your form
  submission to a server should be triggered from UI with the output of this function as parameters:

  ```
  (dom/input { :onClick #(comp/transact! this `[(some-submit-function {:diff ~(f/dirty-fields props true)})]) })
  ```

  ui-entity - The entity (denormalized) from the UI.
  as-delta? - If false, each field's reported (new) value will just be the new value. When true, each value will be a map with :before and :after keys
  with the old and new values (useful for optimistic transaction semantics).

  Returns a map keyed by form ID (for each form/subform) whose values are maps of key/value pairs of
  changes. Fields from entities that have a temporary IDs will always be included.

  In other words, a change that happened for an entity with ident `entity-ident` on field `:field`:

  With `as-delta?` true:

  ```
  {entity-ident {:field {:before 1 :after 2}}}
  ```

  with `as-delta?` false:

  ```
  {entity-ident {:field 2}}
