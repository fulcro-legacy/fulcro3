Fulcro is a library for building data-driven full-stack applications for the web. It uses React and is written in
Clojure and Clojurescript.

Fulcro 3 is current in Alpha (July 2019). The road map is approximately:

- Do regular (at least weekly) alpha releases until the APIs stabilize.
** An alpha release is one that mostly works, but which may still undergo breaking (structural) API changes.
- Move to Beta sometime in July or August 2019.
** Beta will be API-stable releases that still could use rigorous testing.

Official release candidates of version 3 will begin as soon as beta releases have been tested against enough code to give
us high confidence that the library is usable in production. We hope to have an official release of 3.0 by the
end of summer 2019, including updated documentation, videos, and sample application(s).

*NOTE*: If you are using Java 9, you may need to include "--add-modules java.xml.bind" to your JVM.

== Version Differences

Fulcro has undergone a number of face-lifts over its lifetime.

[[Horizontal]]
1.x:: An add-on library for Om Next. Has various limitations as a result of this, and several bugs that are deep within Om Next (which was not getting updates).
2.0 - 2.4:: No longer depends on Om Next. Public API is the same, except where improvements and fixes were needed.
2.5:: Integrated co-located CSS for better support (e.g. localized-dom), made all server dependencies dynamic, rewrite of i18n. This
version requires you to change a few i18n things if you were using it, and adds API to the DOM to make UI much more concise.
2.6:: Changes for React 16+. Changes in React led to a change in the underlying rendering refresh
optimizations.
3.0:: This version. A nearly complete rewrite of the internals.  Simplifies a lot of things, makes others
more extensible, and preserves the shape of the API; however, it is not 100% API compatible with prior versions.  In
particular in the course of fixing some long-standing issues subtle semantic differences were desirable/unavoidable in the
transaction processing system.

== Trying it Out

The documentation is being update in the https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-developer-guide[*new* revision of the Developer's Guide]. The
docstrings in the namespaces have mostly been updated as well.

`defsc`:: The new `defsc` *looks* like the old one, and even does
some of the same error checking (NOTE: there is a known bug in the new props destructuring checks I have not had time
to fix...the workaround is to use lambda query/ident if you run into it). However, `defsc`'s option map now supports user-additions.
Anything you include in that map now appears (unaltered) in `component-options`.  This allows library authors to co-locate
information on a component without having to modify the macro.  The "magic" behaviors of query/ident/initial-state (and error
checking) are still present for developer aid and bw compatibility.  Some of the arities may be wrong. I was considering
making them all lambdas at one point and may have screwed something up. Please report any issues.

Namespaces::

All of the namespaces changed (this may be outdated, as it is still in flux, but is approximately right):

```

=== Creating An Application

Fulcro applications no longer use anything from Om Next. There are no protocols, no reconciler, etc. A Fulcro application
is implemented as a map, and that `app` is usable everywhere the reconciler was in 2.x. There is no need to store it
in an atom because it uses atoms internally to deal with state.

For hot code reload, you should use `defonce` to make your application in some central location that can be used from
any other namespace:

```
(ns my.app
  (:require
    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.networking.http-remote :as fhr]
    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application :as app]
    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.components :as comp]
    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.data-fetch :as df]
    [my.app.ui :as ui]
    [taoensso.timbre :as log]))

(defonce app (app/fulcro-app {:remotes   {:remote (fhr/fulcro-http-remote {:url "/api"})}}))
```

At some point in your logic you will want to associate the root of your UI with the application via `app/mount!`:

```
(app/mount! app ui/Root "app")
```

Calling this function on a mounted app will simply refresh the mounted app's UI.

=== Significant Changes

See also the porting guide in the main repo root at PORTING-FROM-2.3.adoc.

I call these significant more for their long-term implications than their impact on existing code.  Most existing
code will be trivial to port to Fulcro 3, and should operate without much further change; however, some of the
"hard edges" of Fulcro 2 are solved by these changes, and as such they are "significant" in that sense.

==== Defsc

As mentioned earlier: `defsc` no longer uses protocols at all.  The options map is "beefed up" by the `defsc` macro,
but in fact you can simply create a "contructor function" and call `configure-component!` on it and pass a (non-magic)
options map to create a component.  The macro just helps you with typos and is easier to read.

This also means things like CSS can now be a pure library concern. In fact, the `fulcro-garden-css` library is where CSS
functionality lives now.

NOTE: Some things that *were* macros in Fulcro 2.x no longer need to be.  The incubator dynamic routers are an example
of this.  The old union router is still a custom macro because it actually emits more than one thing.  In most cases
just changing the "missing macro" to plain `defsc` will make it work.

==== Transaction Changes

The most significant change is in the internal plumbing of `transact!`, which is now in the `component` namespace.  Transactions are now safe
to submit from *anywhere* in the code base.

The `transact!` function just puts the tx on a submission queue.  That's it.  At some point (very soon) after submission
Fulcro will process the current submissions into an active queue.

NOTE: My intention is to make the transaction plumbing "pluggable" (it is already structured to be) so that various approaches to transaction
semantics can be implemented as standard or even library concerns.

This simplifies a lot of things:

- You no longer need `ptransact!`.  Just embed a `transact!` in some part of the `result-action` (see below) of your mutation.
- Timing issues in dynamic routing and ui state machines should be easier to avoid/solve.
- You can submit transactions without using `setTimeout` and be sure they will activate in the order submitted.

There is an `options` map that can be passed to the new `transact!`. The `optimistic?` flag can be turned to false to
get the exact behavior of `ptransact!` if your application is written to use it.  A wrapper for this called `ptransact!`
will probably be included in Fulcro 3 (undecided).

==== Mutation Generalizations

Mutations have become an even more central notion in the library.  All versions of Fulcro have actually treated loads
internally as mutations, because in fact a load is a combination of some state changes (recording the fact that something
is loading, i.e. load markers) and fetching the actual data.

Prior versions of Fulcro had Om Next structure in the middle.  Version 3 does not.  The logic in 3 is *much* more direct:

- A transaction is written as it always has been
- Each element of the transaction (mutations) can choose local and remote behaviors
- Optimistic actions run first
- Remote actions go on a queue and run in order

All of that should sound pretty much identical to what you've been doing all along.  The big difference is what
happens next:

- Network results are delivered to a new `result-action` section of the mutation.  If the user does *not* supply a `result-action`,
then the `defmutation` macro supplies a default that behaves a bit like Fulcro 2 with some Incubator features added in
(there is now an `ok-action` and `error-action` section as well).

As a result any full-stack operation is completely under your control, and you can even "invent" new sections of
the mutation that will appear as `dispatch` in the `env`:

```
(defmutation do-thing [params]
  (action [env] ...optimistic actions...)
  (remote [env] true)
  (ok-action [env] ...your custom action type!...)
  (result-action [{:keys [result app dispatch] :as env}]
    (let [{:keys [status-code body]} result
          {:keys [ok-action]} dispatch]
      (if (= 200 status-code)
        (ok-action env)
        ...))))
```

This maintains backward compatibility while also giving you the power to implement things like
`pmutate` from incubator without having to resort to magical transaction transforms.   The fact that
you can trigger new transactions from any part of that code means that chaining behaviors is now
trivial and no longer needs the concept of `ptransact!` (though there is an `:optimistic? false` option
of the new `transact!` that emulates that behavior.

Interestingly, this also makes it super easy to generalize the implementation of loads even more than before.
Loads are now implemented internally something like this (simplified for ease of understanding):

```
(defmutation internal-load! [{:keys [query marker] :as params}]
  (action [{:keys [app]}] (set-load-marker! app marker :loading))
  (result-action [{:keys [result app] :as env}]
      (if (load-error? result)
        (load-failed! env params)
        (finish-load! env params))))
  (remote  [{:keys [ast]}] (eql/query->ast query)))
```

NOTE: The `data-fecth` API (e.g. `load`, renamed to `load!`) still exists, and is pretty much like it was. The primary change is boolean/in-place
load markers are no longer supported.

WARNING: The multimethod `mutate` is still at the center of this; however, the arguments have changed.  The multimethod
is sent *only* an `env`, which contains `(-> env :ast :params)`.

=== Using Inspect

Do NOT include Fulcro Inspect as a dependency.  Instead, Fulcro now includes the client-side code necessary to talk
to the Chrome extension without pulling in all of inspect's dependencies. Just add the following preload:

```
 :builds   {:app  {:target     :browser
                   ...
                   :devtools   {:preloads [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.inspect.preload]}}
```

At the time of this writing everything pretty much works, and even has some improved appearance.

=== Breakage

The API has changed in some places in ways that will require you to do some work if porting. See PORTING-FROM-2.x.adoc.

== Status

Version 3 is now officially in Alpha.  Most APIs have been ported, and much of it has even been tested.

Some code (CSS and websockets) were moved to external libraries to reduce dependencies.
